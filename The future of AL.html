Define your business value
There are countless ways to use AI. How do organizations decide what to focus on? To scale successfully, start by defining what value means to your business. Then assess and prioritize the various applications of AI against those strategic objectives.

Rework your workforce
The growing momentum of AI calls for a diverse, reconfigured workforce to support and scale it. Despite early fears that artificial intelligence and automation would lead to job loss, the future of AI hinges on human-machine collaboration and the imperative to reshape talent and ways of working.

Establish governance and ethical frameworks
Organizations must design their AI strategy with trust in mind. That means building the right governance structures and making sure ethical principles are translated into the development of algorithms and software.

Applying these factors successfully can help organizations unlock exponential value and stay competitive. AI is no longer simply a "nice to have", but is critical to a business’ future.
